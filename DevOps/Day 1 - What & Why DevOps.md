## What is DevOps?

If you look at the textbook definition for DevOps, there are hundreds of definitions. However, in practical terms, DevOps is more than just a definition; it's a culture or practice adopted by organizations. The core aim of DevOps is to enhance an organization's ability to deliver applications efficiently.

### End Goal of DevOps:
DevOps is a culture that improves the organization's ability to deliver applications.

### Tell in the Interview:
DevOps is a process of improving the application/script/binary delivery by ensuring proper automation, maintaining code quality, setting up continuous monitoring/observability, and implementing continuous testing.

# Why DevOps?

## The Evolution of Application Delivery

In the traditional software development landscape, the process of delivering applications to end customers was a cumbersome and time-consuming endeavor. Let's take a journey back before the advent of DevOps, around 10 years ago.

### Old Workflow:

1. **Code Development:**
   - Once a developer wrote the code, multiple developers contributed their code to a central location.

2. **Server Creation:**
   - A system engineer or build & release engineer then created a server. This server served as the deployment environment for the application.

3. **Testing on Server:**
   - Testers would test the application on the server created by a system administrator. This was a critical step to ensure the application's functionality and identify potential issues.

4. **Build & Release Engineering:**
   - A Build & Release engineer was responsible for promoting the application to the next levels, such as staging or pre-production, before finally deploying it to the customer in production.

### Challenges:

- **Time-Consuming Process:**
  - The entire process of delivering the application from the developer's laptop to production involved multiple manual steps and roles, leading to a considerable time delay.

- **Server Dependency:**
  - Testing and deploying on servers were essential, but it introduced dependencies on server availability and configuration.

## The Birth of DevOps:

To address the inefficiencies and delays in the traditional workflow, the concept of DevOps emerged. The world of DevOps aimed to streamline and automate the entire application delivery process.

### Key Issues Addressed by DevOps:

1. **Manual Efforts:**
   - The traditional approach involved numerous manual efforts, making the process slow and error-prone.

2. **Server Dependency:**
   - DevOps introduced practices to minimize dependency on manual server configurations, emphasizing automation and infrastructure as code.

3. **Time to Delivery:**
   - The goal of DevOps was to significantly reduce the time it takes to deliver new versions or features of applications from the developer's laptop to production.

## DevOps in Action:

Today, DevOps has become a crucial culture and set of practices within organizations. It emphasizes collaboration, automation, and continuous improvement to achieve faster and more reliable application delivery.

To improve the entire process, organizations worldwide embraced the new concept called DevOps. It's not just about tools; it's a cultural shift that enhances an organization's ability to adapt, innovate, and deliver value to end customers efficiently.

## How to Introduce Yourself as a DevOps Engineer?

- I have been working as a DevOps engineer for the past X years.
- My background includes experience in roles such as system admin/ Build and Release Engineer / Server Administrator / Java/Python Developer, and Cloud Specialist.
- In my current role, I focus on automation, maintaining code quality, setting up continuous monitoring, and implementing automated testing in the DevOps lifecycle.

## Roles and Responsibilities

As a DevOps Engineer, my Roles and Responsibilities revolve around the four pillars of DevOps:

1. **Automation:** Implementing and improving automated processes for building, testing, and deploying applications.

2. **Quality:** Ensuring code quality through practices such as code reviews, static code analysis, and automated testing.

3. **Monitoring:** Setting up and managing continuous monitoring and observability to identify and address issues proactively.

4. **Testing:** Incorporating automated testing into the DevOps pipeline to guarantee the reliability and performance of applications.

## Tools and Technologies

In my current role, I work with various tools and technologies, including:
- CI/CD: Jenkins
- Container Orchestration: Kubernetes
- Configuration Management: Ansible
- Infrastructure as Code: Terraform
- Scripting - Bash & Python
- VCS - Git & GitHub
#### Include tools you know 

## Conclusion

DevOps is not just a set of tools; it's a culture and practice aimed at enhancing an organization's ability to deliver applications efficiently.
