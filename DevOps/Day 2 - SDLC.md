## Introduction

In the field of IT, SDLC is a standardized process followed by organizations to design, develop, and test software products. The end goal is to deliver a high-quality product to customers. Failure to adhere to SDLC standards can result in suboptimal applications.

## SDLC Phases

1. **Planning and Requirements Gathering:**
   - Initial stage where product owners and business analysts collect information from customers.
   - Requirements are defined, laying the groundwork for subsequent phases.

2. **Defining and Designing:**
   - Detailed documentation, such as Software Requirement Specification, is created based on collected information.
   - High-level and low-level designs are developed, focusing on scalability, availability, and specific functionalities.

3. **Building, Testing, and Deployment:**
   - **Building:** Developers write code and push it to a common repository like GIT.
   - **Testing:** QA engineers ensure the code meets quality standards.
   - **Deployment:** Application is promoted to the production server for customer use.

## DevOps Integration

DevOps engineers play a crucial role in improving the efficiency of SDLC phases, particularly in building, testing, and deployment.

- **Building Phase:** DevOps ensures automation in the development process, speeding up code delivery.
- **Testing Phase:** Automation scripts are employed to enhance efficiency and reduce manual intervention in the testing process.
- **Deployment Phase:** DevOps streamlines the deployment process, promoting automation to avoid delays caused by manual steps.

## Agile Methodology

Most organizations follow Agile methodology within the SDLC framework. Agile promotes iterative development, allowing organizations to work in short sprints and deliver increments of the product. This approach ensures that progress is made continuously without waiting for the completion of entire phases.

## Approach

When learning new tools or technologies, DevOps engineers should always consider how they can be applied to improve organizational efficiency. This proactive approach ensures that the tools and skills acquired contribute to the organization's goals.
